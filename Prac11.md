## Content Insights

Looking at LinkedIn and even regular job sites such as Seek and Indeed there aren't many web development specific jobs in Townsville. As I would like to stay in Townsville for a few more years after graduating I would have to look for remote jobs. Although remote jobs have been a lot more popular recently many require at least one day of the week in office. 

## Career/ Employability/ Learning Insights

This subject has given a good insight into what a development cycle could look like for a web developer in a company, going from the first steps of local hosting to updating a live website. It has also shown me that a career in web development is not for me. I understand that the core development cycle used in this subject is applicable to many areas of IT. Perhaps being a backend developer might work for me as I dislike the design and UI parts as it doesn't come to me quickly and it is not my strong suit.
