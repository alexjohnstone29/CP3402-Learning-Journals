I chose to focus on the Pomodoro Technique because it is very simple 

1. Work/Study for 25mins
2. Have a 5min break
3. After four, 5min breaks take a longer 15-30min break

My theory for this technique is that breaking down studying into shorter sessions makes it easier to study knowing that there will be a short break. Also you will retain more information as the study session is not one big session, so you can refocus after each break.

I will test this on another subject that has a lot of reading, often when doing that subject I end up reading the whole chapter but not absorbing the content. I will test myself at the end of the chapter and if I remember most of the content without having to re-check my notes and do well in the weekly quiz.

I feel that the pomodoro technique works well for me, I remembered the content well when I did the self test and I did well on the weekly quiz. This could also apply when working a job as I often find if im stuck on something I take a break and come back refreshed and able to figure out a solution.
