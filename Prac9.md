## Estimated Hours

I spent about 5 hours on the practical almost half of that time was getting sass and gulp wokring

## Content Insights

SASS adds a lot of features that make it easier to use for me. I like Extend/Inheritance it reduces re typing code and I can see this being useful in a big website with a lot of classes and ids. Modules remind me of functions python, where you can put a big function in its own file and refernce back to it at anytime.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I don't think companies are looking specifically for proficiency in SASS but it is simple enough to learn and does not replace CSS.
